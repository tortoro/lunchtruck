# Lunchtruck

For now I am approaching this project from the perspective of building an internal administrative tool for San Francisco's food trucks.
Imagining the user is someone who can benefit from a system pulling in various food truck data from APIs and consolidating it into a
source of truth index for the City to keep track of operating food trucks.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
